# Project Status

**Milestone:** M4 — Platform/HLE expansion  
**State:** M2 controlled execution complete; M3 trace/graphics boundaries integrated; exact opaque SCE import binding registry in progress  
**Repository:** astraea-emu/astraea  
**Active branch:** `feat/m4-sce-import-bindings`

## Complete

- M0 engineering foundation.
- M1 validated `GuestImage`.
- M2 controlled execution on Linux x86-64 and Windows x86-64 for trusted Astraea-owned synthetic probes.
- Astraea-owned `probe_hello.elf` end-to-end proof.
- Public PS5 executable/module ABI evidence map (#8).
- AstraeaProbe v0 request/result contract and deterministic host reference probe (#10).
- Stable Astraea Trace v0 schema, normalization, and canonical serializer (#6).
- Deterministic Trace v0 diff / first-divergence locator (#7).
- RDNA2/PS5 graphics evidence map (#9).
- Raw graphics packet/header preservation slice with synthetic fixtures (#29).
- Evidence-backed SCE dynamic metadata classification/preservation (#30).
- Minimal generic RDNA2 SOPP decoder from AMD document 70648 (#31).
- Minimal host-independent Graphics IR semantic/provenance boundary (#32).
- Minimal host-independent Shader IR for the AMD-documented SOPP subset (#33).
- Graphics/frontend/shader Trace v0 adapters with semantic/provenance separation (#34).
- Opaque SCE long-form dynamic-symbol identity parser (#43).
- Public five-gate CI remains the merge requirement:
  - Linux x64
  - Windows x64
  - macOS ARM64
  - Linux ASan + UBSan
  - Linux Clang fuzz smoke

## Current frontier

1. #45 — exact opaque SCE import identity -> existing HLE function binding registry — in progress on this branch.
2. After #45, define the smallest synthetic relocation/gate integration needed to prove an SCE-shaped unresolved/resolved import path end to end.

## SCE metadata boundary

The #30 slice is additive to the generic dynamic parser:

- classify only current SCE dynamic-tag values documented by #8;
- preserve raw tag/value/source index for every dynamic entry;
- preserve generic, legacy, and otherwise unknown values as `unknown`;
- reject contradictory values for file-global singleton records deterministically;
- keep repeatable module/library records repeatable;
- do not decode undocumented module/library bit packing;
- do not generate NIDs, resolve imports, bind HLE, or guess system-library names.

The existing strict dynamic parser remains responsible for segment bounds, entry
size, arithmetic, and terminator validation.

## Graphics architecture guardrails

The completed #9 evidence map supports separating:

- PS5 command/state frontend
- Graphics IR
- shader-container parsing
- generic RDNA2 instruction decoding
- Shader IR
- SPIR-V lowering
- Vulkan host backend

Guest semantics come first. Raw guest packets are not Vulkan objects, Sony shader-container bytes are not generic RDNA2 instruction semantics, and PS5 must not be assumed to equal desktop `gfx1030`.

Unknown packet/register, shader-ABI, descriptor, surface-layout, synchronization, queue, presentation, and ray-tracing behavior remains explicitly unsupported until stronger evidence or controlled observations justify it.

## Execution boundary

Native execution remains limited to trusted Astraea-owned synthetic probes.

Astraea does **not** currently claim PlayStation 5 software compatibility, and
arbitrary retail guest execution is not enabled.

## Clean-room boundary

Do not commit Sony firmware, Sony keys, proprietary SDK material, decrypted
retail game assets, copyrighted PS5 executables, proprietary system modules,
DRM-bypass material, or unrelated employer/proprietary material.

PS5-specific assumptions require documented evidence.

## Next action

Validate #45 across the five-gate matrix. Resolution must require the exact
opaque NID/library/module triple and an explicitly supplied existing HLE
function ID. No NID/name lookup, fallback resolution, relocation patching, or
system-module loading belongs in this slice.
