## Current frontier

1. #136 — replace the obsolete HLE-then-graphics waterfall with ADR 0006's dependency-driven vertical integration model.
2. V0 is complete: PS5 AGC container -> bounded RDNA2 -> Shader IR is now a tested, fuzzed PS5-specific path in main.
3. V1 is next: an Astraea-owned SCE guest probe should reach the AGC shader-creation boundary and produce a guest-domain Astraea shader object with validated program/stage/provenance state and no Vulkan dependency.
4. The first missing dependency on V1 will be selected only after the architecture refresh is merged. Exact ABI/object semantics must be supported by public evidence or identified as an explicit evidence blocker.
5. SPIR-V/Vulkan work is V2/V3. Broad RDNA2 opcode expansion, broad platform HLE, resource decoding, and command-buffer coverage are pulled forward only by a concrete gate workload.

## SCE metadata boundary

The #30 slice is additive to the generic dynamic parser:

- classify only current SCE dynamic-tag values documented by #8;
- preserve raw tag/value/source index for every dynamic entry;
- preserve generic, legacy, and otherwise unknown values as `unknown`;
- reject contradictory values for file-global singleton records deterministically;
- keep repeatable module/library records repeatable;
- do not decode undocumented module/library bit packing;
- do not generate NIDs, resolve imports, bind HLE, or guess system-library names.

The existing strict dynamic parser remains responsible for segment bounds, entry
size, arithmetic, and terminator validation.

## SCE program-header boundary

The #61 slice is data-only:

- classify only `0x61000000`, `0x61000001`, and `0x61000010` from the #8 evidence map;
- preserve the complete parsed `ProgramHeader` and source index;
- keep generic and unsupported values typed as `unknown`;
- do not infer mapping permissions, process-parameter layout, loader ordering, RELRO transition timing, entry ABI, or dependency behavior.

## Graphics architecture guardrails

The completed #9 evidence map supports separating:

- PS5 command/state frontend
- Graphics IR
- shader-container parsing
- generic RDNA2 instruction decoding
- Shader IR
- SPIR-V lowering
- Vulkan host backend

Guest semantics come first. Raw guest packets are not Vulkan objects, Sony shader-container bytes are not generic RDNA2 instruction semantics, and PS5 must not be assumed to equal desktop `gfx1030`. "Generic RDNA2" means AMD-defined guest ISA semantics shared by the hardware family; it is not placeholder behavior.

Unknown packet/register, shader-ABI, descriptor, surface-layout, synchronization, queue, presentation, and ray-tracing behavior remains explicitly unsupported until stronger evidence or controlled observations justify it.

## Execution boundary

Native execution remains limited to trusted Astraea-owned synthetic probes.

Astraea does **not** currently claim PlayStation 5 software compatibility, and
arbitrary retail guest execution is not enabled.

## Clean-room boundary

Do not commit Sony firmware, Sony keys, proprietary SDK material, decrypted
retail game assets, copyrighted PS5 executables, proprietary system modules,
DRM-bypass material, or unrelated employer/proprietary material.

PS5-specific assumptions require documented evidence.

## Next action

Merge #136 after its exact documentation-only head passes the five-gate CI
matrix. Then create the smallest V1 implementation issue for a guest-domain
AGC shader object / shader-creation boundary.

The V1 issue must first resolve the exact public evidence for the input/output
ABI and guest-memory/object-lifetime contract. It must not introduce Vulkan
handles, decode unrelated AGC resource/register fields, or guess mutable header
semantics. If the exact public evidence is insufficient, split out a bounded
research/probe issue and record that blocker explicitly.

After V1, proceed to V2 with a concrete Shader IR subset chosen by an owned
workload and lower it to validated Vulkan-environment SPIR-V. RDNA2 coverage is
demand-driven by that workload rather than expanded for its own sake.
