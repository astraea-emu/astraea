## Current frontier

1. #134 — parse the smallest evidence-backed PS5 AGC shader-container envelope and expose only its bounded RDNA2 program prefix to the existing decoder.
2. Current public evidence supports ELF64 little-endian `EM_AMDGPU`, `.shader_header` / `.shader_text`, the AGC header magic/size/type fields, and the currently observed 0x30-byte shader-text trailer program-length field. Unknown bytes remain opaque provenance.
3. The parser has an owned synthetic end-to-end AGC -> RDNA2 -> Shader IR gate and a dedicated fuzz target. New RDNA2 opcodes, general FP MODE, resource/descriptor decoding, command execution, SPIR-V, and Vulkan remain out of #134.
4. `docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md` still reflects the original HLE-then-graphics waterfall. The live dependency graph has evolved; a follow-up architecture/roadmap ADR will formalize parallel platform and graphics workstreams with vertical integration gates rather than rewriting working subsystem boundaries ad hoc.

## SCE metadata boundary

The #30 slice is additive to the generic dynamic parser:

- classify only current SCE dynamic-tag values documented by #8;
- preserve raw tag/value/source index for every dynamic entry;
- preserve generic, legacy, and otherwise unknown values as `unknown`;
- reject contradictory values for file-global singleton records deterministically;
- keep repeatable module/library records repeatable;
- do not decode undocumented module/library bit packing;
- do not generate NIDs, resolve imports, bind HLE, or guess system-library names.

The existing strict dynamic parser remains responsible for segment bounds, entry
size, arithmetic, and terminator validation.

## SCE program-header boundary

The #61 slice is data-only:

- classify only `0x61000000`, `0x61000001`, and `0x61000010` from the #8 evidence map;
- preserve the complete parsed `ProgramHeader` and source index;
- keep generic and unsupported values typed as `unknown`;
- do not infer mapping permissions, process-parameter layout, loader ordering, RELRO transition timing, entry ABI, or dependency behavior.

## Graphics architecture guardrails

The completed #9 evidence map supports separating:

- PS5 command/state frontend
- Graphics IR
- shader-container parsing
- generic RDNA2 instruction decoding
- Shader IR
- SPIR-V lowering
- Vulkan host backend

Guest semantics come first. Raw guest packets are not Vulkan objects, Sony shader-container bytes are not generic RDNA2 instruction semantics, and PS5 must not be assumed to equal desktop `gfx1030`. "Generic RDNA2" means AMD-defined guest ISA semantics shared by the hardware family; it is not placeholder behavior.

Unknown packet/register, shader-ABI, descriptor, surface-layout, synchronization, queue, presentation, and ray-tracing behavior remains explicitly unsupported until stronger evidence or controlled observations justify it.

## Execution boundary

Native execution remains limited to trusted Astraea-owned synthetic probes.

Astraea does **not** currently claim PlayStation 5 software compatibility, and
arbitrary retail guest execution is not enabled.

## Clean-room boundary

Do not commit Sony firmware, Sony keys, proprietary SDK material, decrypted
retail game assets, copyrighted PS5 executables, proprietary system modules,
DRM-bypass material, or unrelated employer/proprietary material.

PS5-specific assumptions require documented evidence.

## Next action

Complete #134 as the first PS5-specific shader-ingestion bridge: validate the
documented AGC ELF/header/trailer envelope, preserve unknown bytes, expose only
the bounded program prefix as little-endian RDNA2 dwords, prove the existing
RDNA2 -> Shader IR pipeline end to end with owned synthetic input, fuzz the
parser, and merge only after the exact PR head is green on all five CI gates.

After #134, refresh the architecture/roadmap in an ADR before broadening the
graphics frontend. The next implementation slices should be selected by the
shortest end-to-end path toward AGC shader creation, Shader IR -> validated
SPIR-V, guest GPU state/resources, and a minimal Vulkan execution/output gate
rather than by arbitrary opcode count.
